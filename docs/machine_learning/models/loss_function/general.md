# Loss Function()
The loss function is the objective that the model optimizes during training.
### How it works
Prediction Ability: it determines what the model learns to predict.
Training Speed: this is about how efficiently the model reaches its optimal weights.
1. Guides Weight Updates
The loss's gradient tells the optimizer how to adjust the model's weights.
