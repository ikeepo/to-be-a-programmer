# Backtracking
A recursive strategy.
# How
- Choose, for the current step
- Explore, Recusively try to solve the remaining problem with the current choice
- Backtracking, If the choice lead to an invalid solution, undo it and try another option
- Base Case: stop when a solution is found or all options are exhausted
# Why
- Depth-First Search
Explores one path fully before backtracking.
- Pruncing
Early valitions for option avoids exploring invalid paths
