# What is a Algorithm
Any algorithm is nothing more than [a combination of arithmetic computations and tests](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/398322/what-is-the-purpose-of-using-a-decision-tree).
[All computing](https://www.quora.com/Is-a-decision-tree-just-a-fancy-name-for-a-sequence-of-if-else-if-else-if-else-statements) can be broken down into a few simple operations.
# How to understand a Algorithm
## What Problem it deal with
## What Condition it use?
## What Property it has?
# How to describe an Algorithm
> Your primary job as an algoritm designer is teaching other people how and why your algoritms work.
- What: a precise specification of the problem that the algorithm solves
- How: A precise description of the algorithm itself
- Why: A proof that the algorithm solves the problem it is supposed to solve
- How fast: An analysis of the running time of the algorithm

# Reduction is the single most common technique used in designing algorithm.
Even when you do know precisely how your algorithm part work (lower or higher) , it is often extremely helpful to pretend that you don't .
