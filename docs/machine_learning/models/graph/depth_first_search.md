## From [The Algorithm Design Manual](https://mimoza.marmara.edu.tr/~msakalli/cse706_12/SkienaTheAlgorithmDesignManual.pdf)
> Good algorithm designers understand several fundamental algorithm design techniques, including data structures, dynamic programming, depth-first search, backtracking, and heuristics why depth-first search is here, I thought it was an algorithm , but it seems one thought or consciousness.
- DFS is a systematic exploration strategy: explore as far as possible, then backtrack
- Conceptual Framework: good algorithm designers think in terms of paradigms, DFS fits as a search paradigms.

# Recursive Nature vs Dynamic Programming
DP deals with overlapping subproblems, for memoization optimization.
DFS deals with searching or exploring, no overlapping.
overlapping need optimization, search only for same situation.
