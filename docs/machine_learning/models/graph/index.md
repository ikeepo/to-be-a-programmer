# Graph Concept
A graph is a data structure that represents a set of objects (node or vertex) connected by relationships (edges).
# Concptes
## In Degree
The in degree on a vertex is the number of incoming edges to the vertex.
It counts how many edges point to the vertex from other vertices.
## Out Degree
Number of outgoing edges from that vertex.
### Edges
- Directed()
  - Cyclic
  - Acyclic(DAG, Dependency Graph)
  relationship ,
  CICD, Make,
- Undirected
- Weighted
- Unweighted
# Representations
## Adjacency List
A collection of unordered lists used to represent a finite graph.
Each list describes the set of neighbours of a node in the graph.
## Adjacency Matrix
