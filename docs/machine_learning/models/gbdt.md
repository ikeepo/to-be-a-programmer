# GBDT(Gradient Boosting Decision Tree)
Widely-used machine learning algorithm, due to its efficiency, accuracy, and interpretability.
It is facing chanllenges, especially in the tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency.
GBDT is a machine learning technique that combines two core ideas:
- Gradient Boosting
- Decision Tree
# Process
1. Starting with a basic guess
2. Building trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous ones
3. Using gradients to guide the process
# Key Features
- Weak Learners
- Sequential
- Learning Rate
- Additive
# GBDT vs Random Forest
RF builds trees independently and average them, GBDT builds them sequentially to fix errors.
GBDT doesn't assume linearity or specific distributions.

# Difficult
##### It's unclear how to perform data sampling
