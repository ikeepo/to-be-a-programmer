# Decision Tree
A DT makes predictions by breaking down a problem into a series of yes/no questions, orgranized like a flowchart.
It's called a "tree" because it starts at a root and branches out into nodes (decisions) and leaves (final predictions),
# Terminologies
##### leaf node
A node that doesn't have any child nodes.
##### splitting
The process of dividing a node into two or more sub nodes
##### pruning
The opposite of splitting, that removes subnodes of a decision node.
# Decision Tree vs  If-Else
It is a series of if-else statements.
The key is building these rules **automatically**, it is not really about the tree once built, it is about how we created it.
DT is not exactly in a brute-force, try-everything way. It uses a greedy algorithm to pick the best split at each step.
