# Dynamic Programming
A problem-solving technique to solve complex problems by breaking them down into smaller, overlapping subproblems, solving each subproblem only once.

Each algorithm defines a state, transition, and base case to compute the solution.

Dynamic programming is recursion without repetition.
The proper recursion is much important than memoization.

> Whenever you write - or even think - the word "gree**DY**",   your subconscious is telling you to use **DY**namic programming.
# How to Develop a DP algorithm
1. Formulate the problem recursively
- Specification: Describe the problem rather how to solve, but what the problem
- Solution, give a formula for the problem in terms of the answers to smaller instances of exactly the same problem
2. Build solutions to your recurrence from the bottom up
- identify the subproblems
- choose a memoization data structure
- identify dependency
- Find a good evalution order
- analyze space and running time
- write down the algoritm
# Mechanical Recipe
- Subproblems
- Memoization Strucure
- Dependencies
- Evaluation Order
- Space and time
# What DP mean
The programming is not code, but rather the older sense of planning or schedualing, typically by filling in a table.
