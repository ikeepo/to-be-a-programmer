# [seasonal_decompose](https://www.statsmodels.org/dev/generated/statsmodels.tsa.seasonal.seasonal_decompose.html)
Time series decomposition helps analyze patterns in time series data.
It breaks down data into :
- trend,
The general direction in which the data moves for a long period;
- seasonal
The repeating short-term cycle or pattern
- residual
The random noise that cannot be attributed to trend or seasonality
## [Types](https://www.statology.org/how-to-decompose-time-series-data-into-trend-seasonal-and-residual-components-in-python/)
### Additive Decomposition
The time series is represented as the sum of its components;

### Multiplicative Decomposition
The time series is represented as the product of its components;
## Methods
### Moving Averages

### Classical Decomposition
