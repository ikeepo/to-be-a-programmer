## [Struct VecDeque](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.VecDeque.html)
A double-ended queue implemented with a growable ring buffer.
- [ring buffer:circular buffer]()
When you reach the end of the array, the next position wraps around to the start (index 0) which makes a loop, making it resemble a ring.
