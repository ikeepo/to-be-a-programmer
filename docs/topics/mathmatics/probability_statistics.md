# Probability Statistics
## Probability Density Function
PDF describes the relative likelihood of a random variable (X) taking a specific value (x);
It represents the density of probability at (x).
$F(x) = P(X=x)$
## Cumulative Distribution Function
CDF gives the probability that a random variable (X) is less than or equal to a value (x).
$F(x) = P(X<=x)$
