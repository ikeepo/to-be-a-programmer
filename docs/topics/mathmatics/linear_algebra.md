# Linear Algebra
## [Matrix Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_(linear_algebra))
```python
np.linalg.matrix_rank(matrix)
```
The rank of A matrix is the dimension of the vector space generated by its columns.
Maximal number of linearly independent columns of A.
## [Vector Space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_space)
Also called linear space is a set whose elements, often called vectors, can be added together and mutiplied (scaled) by numbers called scalars.
## Full Rank
If its rank equals the largest possible for a matrix of the same dimension.
## [eigendecomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigendecomposition_of_a_matrix)
The factorization of a matrix into a canonical form, whereby the matrix is represented in terms of its eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
## [factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorization)
use a product of several factors to represent a variable.
## [Eigenvalues and eigenvectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors)

sign flips, scaling, repeated eigenvalues are all valid eigenvalues set.
Result decided by the inner algorithm.
Break thing apart is a good way to understand sth.
- It can reduce the computation to O(log n)
