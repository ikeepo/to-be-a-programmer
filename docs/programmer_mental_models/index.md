## Right Mental 

- Don't worry about trying to understand all of the code.

- As a developer, you may need to work closely with designers. If you understand basic design terminology, you'll have a shared vocabulary and you'll be able to participate in the design process more actively. This can make your workflow more efficient and result in a better user experience.
