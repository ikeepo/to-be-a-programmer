# French Experience Commitment

## Introduction
I try to get CLB 5 of French in 60 days. I need to create a plan and execute it.

Language learning is a skill that must be mastered by the body. The emphasis is on physical acquisition rather than cognition. It is not a type of knowledge that requires deep intellectual exploration, but rather a skill that must be trained until it is embodied — mastered by the body rather than the mind.

Most things in life fall into this category of skill. I have held this view for several years, yet I have not truly committed to any single activity and practiced it consistently over the long term. I hope to conduct such an experiment over the next 60 days.

## Experiment Goal:
Reach French CLB 5 from zero foundation within 60 days.

## Method:
I plan to start directly from speaking question banks. I will not study grammar or pronunciation systematically. Instead, I will select a speaking question, ask ChatGPT to generate a French answer, and then memorize it word by word, sentence by sentence, sound by sound.

Currently, I allocate 3 full hours per day to French.

- 1 hour for research and clarification of knowledge. During this time, I will focus on:Looking up grammar points, Organizing vocabulary and pronunciation

- The remaining time is divided into 30-minute blocks: vocabulary memorization, pronunciation practice, and sentence memorization.

- During fragmented time throughout the day, I will practice word pronunciation only, without focusing on memorization.

## Elimination of Alternative Paths:

For the next 60 days, I will not make any major changes to my learning method. I will deliberately eliminate the feasibility of alternative approaches.

There will be no strategic adjustments, no switching of methods, and no exploration of other learning frameworks.

This is a closed experiment. The execution itself is the focus.
