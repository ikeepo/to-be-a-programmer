# Absolute and Relative Units 
## Absolute Units 
`Absolute length units are of fixed length and are not relative to anything else. `

```shell
- px = It is important to note that while 1px is standardized as 1/96th of an inch for the purposes of CSS layout, the actual physical size of a pixel may differ depending on the display.
```

- 既然是1/96 inch,为什么可能不同。  

因为浏览器会根据DPR(Device Pixel Ratio，由浏览器实现，根据硬件+操作系统共同决定)调整；
