# Pseudo Classes & Elements
Pseudo-classes are special CSS keywords that allow you to select an element based on its specific state or position.

The element's state or position could include:

- When it's active.
- When it's being hovered over by a mouse.
- When it's the first child of a parent.
- When it's the last child of a parent.
- When a link has been visited.
- When it's disabled.

```shell
selector:pseudo-class {
  CSS properties
}
```

## User Action Pseudo-classes
They enable you to change the appearance of elements based on user interactions, improving the overall user experience.

```shell
:hover
:active
:focus
:visited
:focus-within
:enabled
:disabled
:target
```
