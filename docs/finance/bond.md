# Why Bond Price Rise When Interest Rates Fall
The inverse relationship between bond prices and interest rates is a fundamental principle of fixed-income markets.
Bonds pay fixed coupons, if new bonds are issued at lower rates, older bonds with higher coupons become more valuable.
Investores bid up the price of the older bond until its yield matches the new market rate.
Bond price will rise until its return lowered to later low rate.
