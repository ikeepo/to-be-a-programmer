## What is Tariff
Tariffs are taxes imposed by goverments on imported goods.
In the US, American companies pay these taxes when bringing foreign products into the country, often passing some or all of the cost onto consumers through higher prices.
##### How the Tariff Exactly Workd in Real life
- President issue an executive order or proclamation
- The USTR and Department of Commerce provide detailed schedules, Customs and Border Protection enforce;
- Ship arrives at a U.S. port, the importer files an entry with CBP
- CBP classifies the goods using the Harmonized Tariff Scheduale of the US, which assigns a tariff rate based on the product type, origin, and any special policies
- The importer of record - usually a US based company buying the goods - pays the tariff to CBP
Either at entry through an immediate payment or deferred payment who has a customs bond  (typically within 10 days);
The payment goes directly to the U.S. Treasury via CBP, which collects duties as federal revenue.
- Customs Clearance, once the tariff are paid or bonded, CBP releases the goods.
The importer can then take possession and distribute or sell them.
- Importers must keep  records for five years.
##### Who pay in Practice
From Tax Foundation , in Trump's first-term, 75-90% of the tariff were absorbed by US businesses and consumers, not foreign exporters.
##### How it Affect the Currency Rate
- Reduce demand for China's goods, shrinking China's export revenue.
- Exports drive demand for the yuan
Foreign buyers convert USD to RMB, lower demand puts downward pressure on its value, pushing the exchange rate higher (7.3-7.5);
Exports generate demand for yuan because US buyers convert USD to RMB to pay Chinese exporters.
Decrease deman (fewer buying RMB to invest in China);
In real-world international trade, US buyers typically pay Chinese exporters in USD, not RMB.
The importer pay $100 to exporter, then pay $54 to CBP.
- China Manged Devaluation
If the YUAN drops from 7.3 to 8, a $100 Chinese product (costing 730 RMB pre-tariff) would become $91.25,
730成本=100美元；
加关税10%，进口商要付110美元，考虑选择其他产地；
出口商要降价10%，导致进口商只为产品付90美元，外加关税10美元，构成原本的100美元；
如果汇率不降，出口商就要承担10%亏损，如果降汇率，中国要承担少赚10美元，但是出口商可以保持730人民币的收入；

- Capital Outflows Risk
A weaker yuan could trigger capital flight - investors pulling money out of China - further pressuring the currency.
This increases yuan supply (selling RMB for USD);
Less investor demand for yuan-denominated assets (stock, bond) pushes the currency down,
- Speculative Pressure
Forex traders anticipate depreciation when tariffs hit, selling yuan prrmptively.
This self-fulfilling prophecy increases yuan supply in the market, driving its value lower.

- Government Control
The People's Bank of China tightly manages the yuan's value , setting a daily trading band (2%)
- Stimulus Boost
CHina's planned fiscal stimulus and moentary easing aim to bolster domestic demand, reducing reliance on exports.
This could stablize the yuan by offsetting export losses.
