We live in a media era where media is easily accessible, and this is deliberately orchestrated by the upper echelons of society because it can effectively capture your attention.
Every inflential figure, whether well-intentioned or malicious, has their own area of expertise - the field they deeply cultivate and expand vertically, mastering its layers from the inside out, which is how they become prominent. But outside of that domain, they are as foolish, naive, and talkative as any passerby.
This is why I need to build the fundamental analysis pipeline from the base.
