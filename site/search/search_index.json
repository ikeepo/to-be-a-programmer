FaskAPI leverages Python's asyncio and tools like Starlette and Pydantic. Flask is synchronos by default. Django is more monolithic and traditionally synchronous. FaskAPI offers automatic generation of interactive API docs using OpenAPI and ReDoc, based on its integration with Pydantic for data validation. This is a huge advantage when working with teams. Flask and Django need additional work . type-hinting and dependency injection system make it more developer-friendly and less error-prone. data validation reduce boilerplate code. Flask leaves this to the developer, and Django provides a full ORM and a batteries-included approach, hich ia great for large-scale apps but can feel heavy for API-only projects. Flask is simple, and Django is comprehensive but heavier framework. Difference between WSGI and ASGI They are both server-gateway interface in Python, but they serve different purposes. WSGI Web Server Gateway Interface, is a synchronous standard for Python web app, introduced in PEP 3333. it's designed to connect frameworks like Flask and Django; WSGI works by handling one request at a time per worker process, which makes it simple and reliable but limits its ability to handle high concurrency or long-lived connection like WebSockets. ASGI Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface, is the successor to WSGI, designed for Asynchronous programming. It supports Python's asyncio and allows frameworks like FastAPI and Starlett to process multiple requests concurrently within a single process. - server-gateway interface are specifications that define how web servers communicate with web applications or frameworks. gateway is like a gate between the web server and the application, controlling how requests flow in and out. server vs framework A server is the software that listens for incoming requests - like HTTTP requests from traders - and sends back responses. Gunicorn, Uvicorn, Nginx. When you run a server, it's the thing that stays active, waiting for clients to connect. A framework, is a set of tools and libraries that helps you write the appication logic - what happens when a request arrives. It's not a server itself, it's the code that defines routes, processes data, and generates responses. Uvicorn vs Nginx Uvicorn is a ASGI server, Nginx is a web server; An ASGI server is a specialized server designed to run Asynchronous Python app that follow the ASGI specification. A web server, like Nginx or Apache, is a more general-purpose tool that handles HTTP trafiic at a lower level. It excels at tasks like serving static content, managing thousands of concurrent connections, load balancing, or acting as a reverse proxy to forward requests to an ASGI server. In a typical production setup, network requests first hit Nginx, which acts as a web server and reverse proxy, then Nginx decides what to do with them - either serving static content directly or forwarding dynamic requests to an ASGI server. - Reverse Proxy It is a server that sits between clients and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the appropriate backend and returing the responses to the clients.

Gunicorn use multiple workers or threads to achieve concurrency. In Gunicorn , a worker is a separate process spawned to run the WSGI application, each worker can handle one request at a time synchronosly. You can configure multiple workers, where each runs in its own process, leveraging multi-core CPUs. In Gunicorn, you can spawn multiple threads in each worker process, but still synchronos - each thread processes one request fully before moving to the next. In Gunicorn, starting multiple workers means spawning multiple processes, but they all run the same Flask app instance, just in a separate processes. Each worker loads the same application code, including all endpoints, and handles incoming requests independently. ASGI Uvicorn leverages Python's asyncio library to process multiple requests Asynchronous within a single process by default. Uvicorn starts a single event loop - a core feature of asyncio - that listens for incoming requests on a port, like 8000. Each request is treated as an async task. Uvicorn can also scale with multiple processes using the --workers option, where each process runs its own event loop, similar to Gunicorn's multi-process model. FastAPI's inbuilt client FastAPI provides a built-in test client through the TestClient class from the starlett.testclient module. It allows you to simulate HTTP requests - like GET or POST - to your FastAPI app in memory, making it fast and convenient for unit or integration tests. It's synchronous by default, but it works seamlessly with FastAPI's async endpoints. FastAPI doesn't support Python 2 middleware In FastAPI, it's a layer of code that sits between the incoming request and the application's reoute handlers, allowing you to process requests or responses globally. It's built on Starlette's middleware system and can be used for tasks like logging, authentication, or modifying headers. It's a flexible mechanism where you define your own logic to process requests and responses globally. CORSMiddleware built-in middleware in FastAPI, inherited from Starlette, designed to handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing. It allows you to control which external domains - or origins - can access your API, which is crucial when a frontend needs to call your endpoints. Accept header, regex, Some are added to endpoints, some are added to app level. Middlewares have a certain order which is a synchronos manner, but the underlying function can be defined both synchronos or asynchronos. Cross-Origin An origin is defined by the combination of protocol, domain and port. If these differ between the requester and the target, it's a cross-origin request. Cross-Origin refers to a situation in web development where a resource, like a webpage or script, tries to access another reource. Browsers enforce a Same-Origin Policy for security, blocking such requests unless the server explicitly allows them via CORS headers, like Access-Control-Allow-Origin . FastAPI dependencies It allows you to inject resuable logic or resources into your route handlers, promoting code resue and modularity. It's built into the framework's dependency injection system, where you define a function - sync or async - that FastAPI calls automatically before executing an endpoint. dependency injection system is the underlying mechanism FastAPI provides to manage and execute dependencies which are specific functions or logic. dependency vs middleware They seem similar because they both handle pre-processing logic, but they seve different purposes and operate at different levels. dependency are scoped to specific routes or globally via app.dependency(). middleware default globally, I use dependency for precision, middleware for broad tasks. dependency focus on return some data to endpoint, while middleware don't return; dependency overwrite, mock dependency In FastAPI, mocking a dependency and overwriting it are techniques used primarily for testing to isolate and control the behavior of dependices. mock a dependency comes from the pytest fixtures, and dependency overwriting is a FastAPI specific feature using app.dependency_overrides , it allows you temporarily replace a dependency with a mock version during testing. Pydantic runtime type checking; It has three mean functionality: - data validation It ensuring that incoming data is automatically validated and parsed into structured objects. - serialization handle deserialization from requests and serialization for responses; - type safety - generate OpenAPI schemas It powers the FastAPI's automatic documentation. \u534f\u7a0bcoroutines Coroutines in FastAPI are asynchronous functions defined with async def, enabling non-blokcing execution using Python's asyncio lib, They're fundamental to FastAPI's ASGI architechture, allowing it to handle multiple requests concurrently within a single thread, which is ideal for I/O-bound tasks like a trader API wairing on database queries or external services. A coroutine pauses at await statements, yielding control back to the event loop to process other tasks until the awaited operation completes. - coroutine vs function A coroutine is a special type of function defined with async def, while a regular function is defined by def. A coroutine supports Asynchronous execution with await, allowing it to pause and yield control back to the event loop for non-blocking behavior, whereas a regular function runs synchronously, blocking until it completes. coroutine is working within a single thread, without OS-level context switching. Coroutines share the thread's execution time. and it's user level schedule. function don't release control, until completion. background tasks In FastAPI, background tasks allow you to run time-consuming operations after sending a response to the client, leveraging the BackgroundTasks class. It's great for tasks like sending emails, logging trades, or processing data that shouldn't delay the client's response. It's used for handling unnecessary logic Asynchronously; threading.local() It's data whose values are thread specific.

A synaptic connection is the junction where one neuron communicates with anohter. It's where the signla from an axon ( from the sending neuron) passes to the dendrites or cell body of the recoiving neuron. Perceptron It's the simplest artificial neuron model. Takes multiple inputs , each with a weight, computes a weighted sum, applies an activation function(step function) to classifies inputs into two groups. MLP is made of multiple layers of Percptrons. It has an input layer, hidden layers, and output layer. Uses backpropagation with gradient descent to adjust weights and minimize error. Activation Function They take the weighted sum of inputs and transform it into an output. - Step Function output binary - Sigmoid - Tanh - Linear Function Why it's called activation In a real neuron, and action potential is triggered when the input signal crosses a threshold. Error Propagation Error Propagation refers to the process of calculating and distributing the error (difference between predicted and actual outputs) backward through a neural network to update its weights. It's how the network learns from mistakes. The error starts at the output and flows back to earlier layers, telling each neuron how much it contributed to the mistake. Learning rate is same across all layers and inputs within one iteration Learning Rate is the step size in gradient descent, controlling how much weights change. During backpropagation, the rror propagates from the output layer back to the input layer. The same \u03b7 is applied to update all weights across all layers in that single update step; Each weight gets its own gradient, but \u03b7 sets the overall pace. One Hot Encoding / Dummy Encoding OHE is a way to convert categorical variable into a binary vector where each category gets its own column, and only one column is \"1\"(Hot) while the rest are \"0\"; dummy encoding is similar to OHE, but it uses n - 1 columns for (n) categories, dropping one category as a reference(baseline). dummy encoding has fewer columns. In statistics, \"dummy variable\" is a stand-in (or placeholder) for a categorical value. dummy means fake or substitude. When modeling categorical data, statisticians created binary variable to \"stand in\" for these categories. They called them \"dummy variable\" to distinguish them from continuous variables. CNN Convolutional neural network; Comes from the mathematical operation called convolution. Convolution is a way to \"slide\" a small window (called a FILTER or KERNEL) over a larger input (like an image) to detect patterns, blending the filter's values with the input's values at each step. In mathematics and signal processing (19th century), where convolution combines two functions to show how one modifies the other. CNN Concepts filters or kernels each filter learns a different feature from the input. Filters(sometimes called kernels) are small windows or templates that slide over the input data to detect specific patterns or features. The are the core mechanism that makes CNNs powerful for anything with spatial/temporal structure. spartial Refers to anything related to space - position, arrangement, or relationships in a 2D or 3D physical layout. Where proximity matters. temporal Refers to anything related to time - sequence, order, or progression over a timeline. Where the order of events carries information. Other data types: tabular, random, categorical; Kernel is the small matrix of weights that gets applied to a patch of the input data via a mathematical operation called convolution. In practice, people say filter to mean the kernel plus its role in the layer. Each filter learns a different feature from the data. kernel size(window length) The filter slides over 3 time steps at a time to detect local patterns In 1D, the kernel size is a number, like 2 means the length of the window along the sequence. In 2D, it's a pair like (3,3), for height and width of the window. The kernel size defines the structure of the filter, while the kernel weights define the content - what the filter is looking for: Size determines number of weights. - activation - ReLU Rectified Linear Unit A nonlinear activation function defined as f(x) = max(0,x) If input > 0 , output the input unchanged, if the input < 0, outputs 0; 1. add nonlinearity: convolution and dense layers are linear, 2. sparsity, turn negative inputs into 0, reduces computation and helps prevent overfitting by making the network focus on strong signals. 3. Efficiency, avoid vanishing gradients (unlike sigmoid/tanh) ReLU is not arbitrary, it's chosen for practical, mathematical reason and bettle-tested. It's worked from the practice. RNN Recurrent neural networks Output of one step is fed back as input to the next step, allowing it to maintain a \"memory\" of previous inputs. Recurrent means \"to run back\" or \"to return\"; Gradient vanishing Gradient vanishing happens when the gradients become extremely small as they propagate backward through layers or time steps.

Learning Rate(Stepsize) \u03b7 dynamic learning rate will decrease over time. \u03b1/\u03c4 - too small would slow converging - too large would be overshooting, potentially missing the minimum or diverging. Gradient Descent GD is an optimization algorithm commonly used in ML - typically a loss or cost function - by iteratively adjusting the parameters of a model. 1. Objective, a cost function J(\u03b8) which variables represent the parameters you want to optimize. 2. Gradient Calculation: gradient the vector of partial derivatives with respect to each parameter. This gradient points in the direction of the steepest increase of J(\u03b8) ; 3. Step in Opposite Direction: \u03b8 = \u03b8 - \u03b7*\u03b4J(\u03b8) which \u03b7 is called Learning Rate \uff0c a small positive number that controls the step size. 4. Iterate: Repeat the process until the paramters converge to a point where the gradient is near zero or a stopping criterion is met. Convergence stop learning when : 1. changes in J(\u03b8) or \u03b8 become negligible 2. after a set number of iterations 3. meet a stopping criterion Batch Gradient Descent vs GD BGD uses the entire dataset to compute the gradient of the cost function in each iteration. It calculate the gradient by averaging the contributions of all data points. GD is normally the BGD; SGD Stochastic Gradient Descent uses just one data point; Mini-Batch GD uses a small subset of the dataset ; Loss or Cost function cost function is typically the aggregate or average of the loss function over the entire dataset. Analytical Approach it refers to solving a problem - here, finding the optimal parametrs that minimize a loss function - by using exact mathematical formulas, rather than numerical or iterative methods like GD. Magnitude Maganitudes is a scalar value which typically refers to the size or length of the gradient vector, which indicates how steep (steepness) the cost function is at a given point. It's the Euclidean norm (or length) of the vector; \u2223\u2207J(\u03b8)\u2223=(\u2202J\u2202\u03b81)2+(\u2202J\u2202\u03b82)2+\u2026 norm A norm is a function that measures the size or length of a vector in a vector space. It's a way to quantify how big or significant a vector is, generalizing the idea of distance or magnitude. The Edlidean norm is one specific type of norm, commonly used because it corresonds to the straight-line distance we're familiar with in everyday geometry. A norm is a ruler for vectors. The norm comes from Latin norma, means a carpenter's square or rule - a tool for measuring or setting a standard. By the 17th century, it evolved in English to mean a standard or pattern . Norm is neutral, technical term focused on measurement, not authority or personality like King or boss. In the 19th, mathematicians adopted norm to describe a function that measures size or length in a sonsistent, standardized way, aligning with its meaning as a rule or measure. correlation correlation it's relationship between two variables- how they move together . coefficient correlation coefficient is a specific numerical measure that quatifies the strength and direction of the correlation between two variables. It is the precise metric that measure correlation. Coefficient is just a number that tells you sth speficic about a relationship . It's term mathematicians have long used for numbers that describe a specific peroperty or relationship in a formula. Bias - Variance Bias Bias is the error due to overly simple assumptions in the model. Variance It is the error due to sensitivity to small changes in the training data. Variance means how much sth changes or varies. In ML, it's about how much a model's predictions wiggle when you give it slightly different training data.","title":"Intro"},{"location":"topics/machine_learning/general/#intro","text":"Things need to be done not because it's absolutely right or good, just because it have relative value for users.

It's not necessary to use this class, but it adds a nice touch. What the nice touch mean? Now it's your turn!

In addition to specifying a subset like you did before, you'll also need to specify the font weight. WHY?
